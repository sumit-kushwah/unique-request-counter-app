# Thought Process

## Basic Solution

### Overview
The basic solution is designed to handle unique request counts and log them periodically. It uses an in-memory map to track unique requests and logs the count every minute.

### Components
1. **Logging Setup**: Initializes a logger to write logs to `log.txt`.
2. **HTTP Server**: Uses the Gin framework to handle HTTP GET requests at the `/api/verve/accept` endpoint.
3. **Request Handling**: The `acceptHandler` function processes incoming requests, checks for unique IDs, and optionally sends a GET request to an endpoint.
4. **Periodic Logging**: A goroutine logs the count of unique requests every minute.

### Key Functions
- `acceptHandler`: Handles incoming requests, checks for unique IDs, and optionally sends a GET request.
- `main`: Sets up logging, initializes the HTTP server, and starts the periodic logging goroutine.

### Thought Process
1. **Logging**: Ensure that all activities are logged for debugging and monitoring purposes.
2. **Concurrency**: Use a mutex to handle concurrent access to the `uniqueRequests` map and `uniqueRequestsCount`.
3. **Periodic Task**: Use a goroutine to periodically log the count of unique requests.

## Extended Solution

### Overview
The extended solution builds on the basic solution by adding Redis for persistent storage and Kafka for message publishing. It handles unique request counts, stores them in Redis, and publishes the counts to a Kafka topic periodically.

### Components
1. **Environment Variables**: Reads Redis and Kafka addresses from environment variables.
2. **Redis Client**: Connects to Redis to store and check unique request IDs.
3. **Kafka Writer**: Connects to Kafka to publish messages.
4. **HTTP Server**: Uses the Gin framework to handle HTTP GET requests at the `/api/verve/accept` endpoint.
5. **Request Handling**: The `acceptHandler` function processes incoming requests, checks for unique IDs in Redis, and optionally sends a POST request to an endpoint.
6. **Periodic Publishing**: A goroutine publishes the count of unique requests to Kafka every minute.

### Key Functions
- `connectRedisClient`: Connects to Redis using the provided address.
- `connectKafkaWriter`: Connects to Kafka using the provided address and topic name.
- `acceptHandler`: Handles incoming requests, checks for unique IDs in Redis, and optionally sends a POST request.
- `sendPostRequest`: Sends a POST request with the unique request count to a specified endpoint.
- `sendToKafka`: Publishes the unique request count to a Kafka topic.
- `main`: Sets up Redis and Kafka connections, initializes the HTTP server, and starts the periodic publishing goroutine.

### Thought Process
1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to configure Redis and Kafka addresses for flexibility.
2. **Redis Integration**: Use Redis to store and check unique request IDs for persistence.
3. **Kafka Integration**: Use Kafka to publish unique request counts for further processing or monitoring.
4. **Concurrency**: Use a mutex to handle concurrent access to the `uniqueRequestsCount`.
5. **Periodic Task**: Use a goroutine to periodically publish the count of unique requests to Kafka.

### Conclusion
The extended solution enhances the basic solution by adding persistent storage with Redis and message publishing with Kafka, making it more robust and scalable.
